1.0 Project Introduction

Vision loss remains one of the most challenging global health issues, with millions of people affected by preventable or treatable eye diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on the expertise of ophthalmologists and specialized imaging equipment, which are often limited in availability—especially in under-resourced regions.
This project presents an AI-powered eye disease classification system that leverages deep learning models to automatically analyze Fundus and OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images. By using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system is capable of identifying multiple vision-threatening conditions, including Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, CNV, DME, and Drusen.
The solution integrates:
•	A user-friendly web-based interface
•	Lightweight TensorFlow Lite models
•	A backend built with Flask for rapid image processing and prediction
The system not only classifies the disease but also provides customized medical advice and surgical recommendations, making it a potential tool for real-time, AI-assisted screening and patient guidance.
This project bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and real-world medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance accessibility, accuracy, and early intervention in eye care.

21.0 Challenges and Limitations
While the system is effective in controlled tests, several challenges remain in real-world deployment. Addressing these will be crucial for large-scale, safe adoption.

21.1 Image Quality Issues
•	Blurry, underexposed, or overexposed images reduce prediction accuracy
•	Common in mobile capture or low-cost fundus/OCT devices
•	Result: Low-confidence predictions → labeled “Other”
Mitigation: Add preprocessing checks or image enhancement pipeline.

21.2 Limited Dataset Diversity
•	Dataset may lack representation from various ethnicities, age groups, or rare conditions
•	Risk of model bias or reduced generalization in unseen demographics
Mitigation: Acquire additional annotated datasets from global sources.

21.3 Class Imbalance
•	Some conditions (e.g., “Normal”) are overrepresented
•	Others (e.g., CNV, Drusen) are rare → undertrained
Mitigation:
•	Apply class weighting
•	Use synthetic oversampling (SMOTE, GANs)

21.4 Low-Confidence Predictions
•	Model may give poor confidence in ambiguous or borderline images
•	In such cases, system defaults to “Other” for safety
Risk: May frustrate users or under-diagnose critical cases.

21.5 Interpretability Limitations
•	Model outputs a label but does not explain “why”
•	No visual explanation like Grad-CAM implemented yet
Mitigation (future): Add visual heatmaps to highlight decision areas.
21.6 Clinical Validation Pending
•	Not yet certified by medical regulators (FDA, CE)
•	Not intended to replace professional diagnosis
21.7 Hardware Constraints
•	TFLite models are lightweight but not optimized for all devices
•	Performance varies across browsers and CPUs
Mitigation: Use ONNX, CoreML, or model quantization if needed.
21.8 Security and Privacy Risks
•	Images transmitted over the web could be intercepted if not secured
•	Lacks full HIPAA/GDPR compliance in current form
Mitigation: Add HTTPS, encryption, and optional local-only mode.
